    <h2 style="color: red;">About let var and const</h2>

    <p>to overcome the limitations of var , let and const are introduced 
    var is a global scope can be re assign and also can be redeclared<br>
    let can be re assign but cannot re declare 
    const cannot be reassign and also cant be redeclared 
    let and const are called as  block scope</p>

    <h2 style="color: red;">spread operator/ rest operator</h2>
    <p> Both are mentioned as ... (three dots) <br>
        spread can be used in normal as well as arrays, can use many number of spread operators <br>
        rest operator can be used in arrays and inside the functions  => put the rest of array elements, we cannot use many operators
        <br> must be the last parameter of the function. if not it throws error 
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: red;">destructuring</h2>
    <p>JavaScript expression that allows unplug the values from arrays or properties of objects.
        datas can be extracted from array , objects , nested objects. <br>
        if we have n number of datas , and if we want to extract some particular data of a particular person ,
        then we can go for destructuring 
        </p>
